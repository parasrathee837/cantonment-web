   STEP 5: START YOUR CBA PORTAL SERVER (POSTGRESQL)
===========================================================

This is like turning on your application with PostgreSQL power!

===========================================================
   THE EASY WAY:
===========================================================

1. Find the file: "start-cba-portal-postgresql.bat" in this folder
2. Double-click it
3. A black window opens with green/blue text
4. Look for this information:
   
   ===========================================================
      CBA PORTAL - POSTGRESQL EDITION - RUNNING
   ===========================================================
   
   ✓ Database: PostgreSQL (Professional Grade)
   ✓ Server Status: STARTING...
   
   Your IP Address: 192.168.1.100 (example)
   
   Access from this PC: http://localhost:5000
   Access from network: http://192.168.1.100:5000

5. IMPORTANT: KEEP THIS WINDOW OPEN!
   - Don't close it
   - Minimize it if you want
   - The server runs as long as this window is open

===========================================================
   WHAT YOU'LL SEE (PostgreSQL SPECIFIC):
===========================================================

The black window shows:
✓ "PostgreSQL service: RUNNING"
✓ "Database: PostgreSQL (Professional Grade)"
✓ "Connected to PostgreSQL database: cba_portal"
✓ "Server running on port 5000"
✓ Your IP address for network access

===========================================================
   POSTGRESQL DATABASE INFO:
===========================================================

You'll also see database information:
- Database Management: pgAdmin 4
- Database: cba_portal
- Username: cba_admin
- Server: localhost:5432

This is much more detailed than SQLite!

===========================================================
   UNDERSTANDING THE IP ADDRESS:
===========================================================

You'll see something like:
- 192.168.1.100
- 192.168.0.105
- 10.0.0.50

This is YOUR computer's address on the network.
Other computers use this to connect to you.

Write it down: _________________

===========================================================
   TO STOP THE SERVER:
===========================================================

When you want to stop:
1. Click on the black window
2. Press Ctrl + C
3. Type Y if asked
4. Window can now be closed
5. PostgreSQL service keeps running (that's good!)

===========================================================
   POSTGRESQL SERVICE VS APPLICATION:
===========================================================

IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE FROM SQLITE:

PostgreSQL has TWO parts:
1. PostgreSQL SERVICE (always running in background)
2. CBA PORTAL APPLICATION (this black window)

- PostgreSQL service: Runs automatically, manages database
- CBA Portal app: Only runs when you start it (this window)

===========================================================
   CREATE DESKTOP SHORTCUTS:
===========================================================

For easy access:
1. Find "start-cba-portal-postgresql.bat"
2. Right-click on it
3. Choose "Send to" → "Desktop (create shortcut)"
4. Now you have an icon on your desktop!

Also create shortcut for database management:
1. Find "view-database-postgresql.bat"
2. Right-click → "Send to" → "Desktop (create shortcut)"
3. Name it "CBA Database Manager"

===========================================================
   SERVER RULES (POSTGRESQL):
===========================================================

Remember:
✓ Server PC must stay ON
✓ Don't close the black APPLICATION window
✓ PostgreSQL service runs automatically (good!)
✓ Don't sleep/hibernate the PC
✓ One application window at a time

===========================================================
   TROUBLESHOOTING:
===========================================================

"PostgreSQL service not found":
- PostgreSQL didn't install properly
- Run install-postgresql.bat again

"Database connection failed":
- PostgreSQL service not running
- Check: services.msc → postgresql-x64-15
- Or run: net start postgresql-x64-15

"Port 5000 already in use":
- You already have a server running
- Close all black windows and try again

"Cannot find module 'pg'":
- PostgreSQL driver not installed
- Go back to Step 4

===========================================================
   POSTGRESQL ADVANTAGES YOU'LL NOTICE:
===========================================================

Compared to SQLite, you'll see:
✓ Faster startup with large data
✓ Better performance with multiple users
✓ Professional database management tools
✓ Detailed connection and query information
✓ Advanced backup and recovery options

===========================================================
   NEXT STEP:
===========================================================

Server is running with PostgreSQL! Open "STEP-6-Access-Portal.txt"

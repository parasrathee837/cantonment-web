QUICK DATABASE SETUP - CBA PORTAL
=================================

PROBLEM: Your database is missing tables needed to store staff information

SOLUTION: Run this single file:
> setup-database-tables.bat

This file contains everything needed - no external files required!

WHAT IT DOES:
1. Connects to your PostgreSQL database
2. Creates all missing tables
3. Preserves your existing admin user
4. Makes the application work properly

TABLES IT CREATES:
- user_complete_profile (detailed staff information)
- attendance (attendance records)
- leaves (leave management)
- payslips (salary information)
- codes (function/object codes)
- files (document storage)
- notifications
- audit_logs
- settings

AFTER RUNNING:
1. Login to admin portal with your existing credentials
2. Create new staff - all data will be saved
3. Use monitor-cba-database.bat to verify

IF YOU GET ERRORS:
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- Verify password is correct
- Run as Administrator if needed

This is a self-contained solution - just run the .bat file!
